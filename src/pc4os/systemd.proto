In failed mode, failed units are not unloaded until the user invoked systemctl reset-failed on them to reset the failed state, or an equivalent command. This behaviour is altered if this option is set to inactive-or-failed: in this case the unit is unloaded even if the unit is in a failed state, and thus an explicitly resetting of the failed state is not necessary.

From this point on, the restart logic is activated again. Note that systemctl reset-failed will cause the restart rate counter for a service to be flushed, which is useful if the administrator wants to manually start a unit and the start limit interferes with that. Note that this rate-limiting is enforced after any unit condition checks are executed, and hence unit activations with failing conditions do not count towards this rate limit.
